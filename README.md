# Data_Wrangling_Capstone1

This Repository contains the PDF report (Data_Wrangling_Report(2).pdf for the data wrangling done for for the Capital Bikeshare Prediction project. The PDF describes what was done to the data to clean it up and how datasets were joined together. It also explains how outliers were handled in the final combined dataset. The Jupyter Notebook that was used to create the pdf is also included (Data_Wrangling_Report.ipynb).

The repo also contains the Jupyter Notebook of the code from which the report was created (cleaning files for each quarter) and the data used in the code (day.csv and 2011-Q1-cabi-trip-history-data.csv). The remaining quarterly datasets from Capital Bikeshare are too big for this repository so they were not included. They can be found at this URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html
